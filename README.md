# RAG--Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-
This project demonstrates the implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using the Langflow framework. RAG is an advanced approach that combines retrieval-based methods with generative models to enhance the accuracy and relevance of responses by fetching relevant documents from a knowledge base before generating the final output.
